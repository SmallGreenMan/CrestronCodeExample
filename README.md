Each of the 16 working places has its own touch panel with specific personal functionality.

There are also 3 monitors, a keyboard and a mouse at each working places. The user at the workplace can connect video, audio and USB from any of the 60 workstations located in the server room. One workstation can be connected simultaneously to only 3 physical PCs.
